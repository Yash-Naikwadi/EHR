              <h2>Who We Are</h2>
              <p>
                We are a dedicated team of healthcare professionals and
                technologists committed to revolutionizing the way Electronic
                Health Records (EHR) are managed. Our mission is to provide a
                secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform for managing EHR.
              </p>

              <h2>What We Do</h2>
              <p>
                Our EHR management system provides a comprehensive solution for
                Doctors, Patients, and Diagnostic Centers. We leverage the
                power of Ethereum blockchain for secure data storage and smart
                contracts for access control and data management.
              </p>

              <h3>For Doctors</h3>
              <p>
                Doctors can access the patient list assigned to them, view
                patient records and medical history, and write comments and
                treatment plans for treating patients.
              </p>

              <h3>For Patients</h3>
              <p>
                Patients can view their own medical records and history, upload
                new medical records, test reports, and other documents, and
                grant access to doctors.
              </p>

              <h3>For Diagnostic Centers</h3>
              <p>
                Diagnostic Centers can view comments and treatment plans from
                doctors and upload EHR reports to patient records.
              </p>

              <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
              <p>
                We are committed to ensuring the integrity and security of
                patient data. Our system ensures that only authorized users
                have access to patient records. Patients have control over who
                can access their medical records and can grant or revoke access
                as needed.
              </p>
